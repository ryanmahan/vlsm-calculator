# vlsm-calculator

A web interface used to design and calculate VLSM subnetting. View it on [my website](http://ryanlmahan.com/vlsm) Inspired by [my favorite FSM designer](http://madebyeric.com/fsm), the canvas manipulation code comes from that site. I modified some of the controls for the canvas, and created the VLSM subnetting calculations. 

## Run it
Clone the respository, and open index.html in a modern browser. You can control the canvas with your mouse, and the instructions are on the page.

## Todo
- [ ] Modernize canvas code
- [ ] Better inline commenting on canvas code
- [ ] More appealing frontend design
- [ ] Better methods of seeing subnet info rather than modal
